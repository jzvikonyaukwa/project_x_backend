# Conversions:

### Convert kgs to meters:

Meters = weight in kgs / conversionRate

```
if width = 925mm then we need the gauge to convert the weight to meters
    if gauge = 0.25 then conversionRate = 1.836
    if gauge = 0.27 then conversionRate = 1.983
    if gauge =0.30 then conversionRate = 2.204
    if gauge =0.40 then conversionRate = 2.974
    if gauge =0.47 then conversionRate = 3.494
    if gauge =0.50 then conversionRate = 3.718
    if gauge =0.55 then conversionRate = 4.0
    if gauge =0.58 then conversionRate = 4.312
    if gauge =0.80 then conversionRate = 5.949
else width != 925
    gauge * 1 * 8.039

# Outsourced Products

The following products are outsourced and can be added to quotes:

* ### Valley Gutters
* ### Roll Top Ridges
* ### Flashings

# Workflow

To add an outsourced product to a quote:

1. Select the product under the consumables section.
2. Specify the quantity and set the price per unit.

## Example
| Product | Quantity | Price per Unit |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| Roll Top Ridges | 8 | $2.10 |

## Quote Approval

When a quote containing outsourced products is accepted, a cutting list is automatically generated. 
This list calculates the necessary amount of raw material (plain sheet) for each outsourced product.

**Formula:**  
Total Length of Plain Sheet = Quantity Ã— 2.4

## Delivery

Once the cutting list is completed, it will be ready for inclusion in the delivery note under the .
